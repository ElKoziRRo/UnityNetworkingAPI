# Unity Networking API
 
Why I made this repository?

I wanted to learn about networking in Unity/C#, so I would be able to make a card game which is also multiplayer. In that way, after digging the internet I've found [Tom Weiland](https://github.com/tom-weiland/tcp-udp-networking/) tutorial series, so I used his tutorials as base to start my work.

### Goal

The goal was to build a server and a client project that could be used as default whenever I start a new project.

### Projects

I decided to split the work in two separated unity projects with the basic networking functionalities:

1. The [Client Project](/UnityNetworkingAPI/UnityGameClient).
2. The [Server Project](/UnityNetworkingAPI/UnityGameServer).

Once both projects are configurated there are base classes of a client or server to inherit from. These classes implement all the basics functionalities in the respective projects.

### How to use it? 

There are some steps in order to get everything working and configurated. They are described below.

### Creating the Server Application



#### Configurating the Server

### Creating the Client Application

#### Configurating the Client
