# Unity Networking API
 
Why I made this repository?

I wanted to learn about networking in Unity/C#.


## Projects 

Digging the internet a bit I've found [Tom Weiland](https://github.com/tom-weiland/tcp-udp-networking/) tutorial series, based on it I decided to make these two separated unity projects with the basics networking functionalities:

1. A base [Client Project](/UnityNetworkingAPI/UnityGameClient).
2. A base [Server Project](/UnityNetworkingAPI/UnityGameServer).


## Base Classes for a Simple App

Whenever I start a new project I am able inherit from the respective bases classes in each project. 
1. Base class for a [Client Application](/UnityNetworkingAPI/UnityGameClient/Assets/Scripts/NetworkClient/BaseNetworkApplication.cs)
2. Base class for a [Server Application](/UnityNetworkingAPI/UnityGameServer/Assets/Scripts/Server/BaseServerApplication.cs)
