# Unity Networking API
 
Why I made this repository?

I wanted to learn about networking in Unity/C#.

After finding [Tom Weiland](https://github.com/tom-weiland/tcp-udp-networking/) tutorial series, I decided to make two separated base applications with the basics networking functionalities for both client and server.

With that, whenever I start a new project I am able just inherit from a base class it and I will be good to go: Client and Server will be talking each other.
