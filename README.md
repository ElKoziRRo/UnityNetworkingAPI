# Unity Networking API
 
Why I made this repository?

I wanted to learn about networking in Unity/C#. Digging the internet a bit I've found [Tom Weiland](https://github.com/tom-weiland/tcp-udp-networking/) tutorial series, I used his projects as base to start my work.

### Goal

The goal was to build a server and a client project that could be used as default whenever I start a new project.

### Projects

I decided to split the work in two separated unity projects with the basic networking functionalities:

1. The [Client Project](/UnityNetworkingAPI/UnityGameClient).
2. The [Server Project](/UnityNetworkingAPI/UnityGameServer).

Once both projects are configurated there are base classes for the client and the server, in that way is just to inherit from the respective classes and you are good to go. 

### How to use it? 

There are some steps in order to get everything working and configurated. They are described below.

### Creating the Server Application

#### Configurating the Server

### Creating the Client Application

#### Configurating the Client
